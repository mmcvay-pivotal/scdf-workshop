# Getting Started with Spring Cloud Data Flow
A Spring Cloud Data Flow workshop 

1. The workshop contains a number of labs that we will go through to demonstrate the capabilities of SCDF.


## Applications
1. [`trucks`](https://github.com/mmcvay-pivotal/scdf-workshop/tree/master/labs/trucks-example/trucks) — generates trucks in random interval
2. [`brake-temperture`](https://github.com/mmcvay-pivotal/scdf-workshop/tree/master/labs/trucks-example/brake-temperature) — computes moving average of truck's brake temperature in 10s interval
3. [`brake-logs`](https://github.com/mmcvay-pivotal/scdf-workshop/tree/master/labs/trucks-example/brake-logs) — prints the truck data
4. [`thumbinator`](https://github.com/mmcvay-pivotal/scdf-workshop/tree/master/labs/trucks-example/thumbinator) — a task/batch-job that can create thumbnails from images
